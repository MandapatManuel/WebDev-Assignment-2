        <h3>BRIEF BIO</h3>
        <p>Humans are the most superior creatures amid all the creatures in the entire universe. 
          Being a part of this universe makes me feel small and minuscule in a world where there millions 
          of humans like myself. Although everyone is quite unique in their own way. I try my best to be 
          humble, kind and respectful of everybody I meet regardless of their age, gender, family background,
           nationality or race. It is not an easy task to write about oneâ€™s self because one may tend to either
            over exaggerate or fail to give succinct descriptions and commendations where necessary.  It is with 
            this background that I introduce myself.

          My name is Manuel S. Mandapat III. I was born on the 5th of September in 2001, which means I am 19 years 
          old now. I have been living and studying in Pangasinan. I love going to mountains using my bicycle and I
           have always taken my studies very seriously. I have got big dreams, when it comes to studies. Since I was
            15 years old, I decided to be IT expert in Facebook Company. So that is my goal and I always try to aim
             to do my best at school, so hopefully my hard work will pay off in the end. I don't really know why I
              decided to be IT expert. I just love games. Some interests I have got are; biking, watching movies,
               playing basketball, playing table tennis, and praying. I love to bike, because bike can remove my
                stress. Moving on to my favorite movies are all action movies. Playing basketball and table tennis
                 has been a huge interest of mine. Playing is one of the bounding that I love in our family. Then 
                 last but not least I love praying. I pray as much as I can. Being a Christian and not praying, just
                  doesn't go together, so that is why I pray. I also feel that whenever I pray, it helps me getting
                   forward and achieving more and more.
